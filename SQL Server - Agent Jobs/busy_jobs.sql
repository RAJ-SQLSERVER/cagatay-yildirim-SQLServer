/* [busy_jobs.sql]
PURPOSE
	identify hotspots when several SQLAgent jobs all fire simultaneously
	
HISTORY
	20090325 dbaker	created

NOTES
1.	having peaks when several jobs are each scheduled for same kick-off is bad
- security authorisations to AD/DC may get lost (UDP) or delayed (hence login fails)
- spikes for CPU/memory/disk/network can deplete resource pools and cause retries/timeouts
2.  so although any decent system OUGHT to cope, real-world suggests that offset pragmatism is better
- up to DBAs to watch for hotspots, and fine-tune any such (even 10-second separation is enough)
