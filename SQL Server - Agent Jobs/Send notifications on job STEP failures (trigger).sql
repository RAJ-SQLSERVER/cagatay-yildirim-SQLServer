/*
Send notifications on job STEP failures (trigger)

Have you ever wanted to have SQL note a failure on a step, yet continue running the job.  
I found it to be annoying that you have to fail (and end) a job in order to send a message to an operator. 

I have processes that run at off times, I want to know when there are failures but I need the remainder of my steps to run, period. 

This trigger makes use of xp_sendmail to send emails to someone, as well as generate an error in SQL's error log.  

I welcome any comments, suggestions and criticisms.
