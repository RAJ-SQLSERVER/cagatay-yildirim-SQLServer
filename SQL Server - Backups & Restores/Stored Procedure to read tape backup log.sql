/*
Stored Procedure to read tape backup log

If you need to check that the tape back of your database backup files was successful, you would generally read the errorlog for the backup software.

If you are just interested in today's results or a particular day's log it can be a pain to get.  
You could have a shortcut on the desktop or you could get SQL to do the reading for you.  

I wrote this stored procedure to give me todays content from the tape backup log.  
If I pass it a string containing the date e.g. '20020202' it will return entries for that day.

It can be easily adapted for reading just about any text file.
