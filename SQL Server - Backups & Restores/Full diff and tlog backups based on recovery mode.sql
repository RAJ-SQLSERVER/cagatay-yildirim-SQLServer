/*to implement:
    A-execute sql script to create three stored procedures, usp_fullbackups, usp_diffBackup and
      usp_Tlogbackup.
    B-create visual basic script file by following instructions in VBScript section.
    C-Change all 5 paths in marked areas
        Path change 1, change -BkupDB path to location of full backups
        Path change 2, change this path to point to location of diffBackupFileDelete.VBS
        Path change 3, change path to location of differential backups
        Path change 4, change Path next to -BkUpLog to location of transaction log backups
        Path change 5, change path to physical location of vbscript file
    D-Change length of times to keep full, differential or transaction log backus where marked
        Change retention date 1 next to -DelBkups i.e. 2days, 2weeks, etc.
        Change retention date 2 next to -DelBkups i.e. 2days, 2weeks, etc.
        Change retention date 3, change number to subtract from now date
                i.e. 1 to delete after 1day, etc
    E-In SQL Agent, create and enable following jobs
        1.Full Backups, step one type command: exec dbo.usp_fullbackups
        2.Differential backups, step one type command: exec dbo.usp_diffBackup
        3.Transaction Log Backups, step one type command: exec dbo.usp_tlogBackup. 
        Set each job to run according to policy (e.g. full backups weekly, differential daily,
        and tlogs hourly around full and differential times). 
    F- monitor jobs to ensure they execute and check for sufficient disk space.    
    G-also ensure that sql server and agent accounts have sufficient access to backup and vb script 
      directory.
