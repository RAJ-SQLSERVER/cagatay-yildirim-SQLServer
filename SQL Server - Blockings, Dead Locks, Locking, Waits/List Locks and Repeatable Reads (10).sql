/*
List Locks and Repeatable Reads

Description

Sample script that lists locks and repeatable reads. The Transaction Isolation level is set to repeatable read. Note that, when xlocks are requested, key xlocks are held until the commit. The trace flag 1211 disallows lock escalation. This script, contributed by Microsoft's Tom Davidson, requires SQL Server 2005.
