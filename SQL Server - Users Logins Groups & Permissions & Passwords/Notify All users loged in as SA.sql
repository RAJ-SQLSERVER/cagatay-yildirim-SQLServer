/*
Notify All users loged in as SA

Procedure that net sends a message to any user who logged in as SA.
IN. had to use this once in the company where SA password was blank for a while and managment did not want to set a password on the account. 
You can also set it to work with any username or for users that login to SQL Server from other machines.
With couple of more statements you can also automatically kill the process of that user.
