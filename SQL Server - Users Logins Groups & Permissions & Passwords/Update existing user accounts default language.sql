/*
Update existing user accounts default language.

When changing the default language of a server it is neccessary to run sp_defaultlangauge against any existing logins. The reason is default language only effects any new accounts created after this change is made. This script is designed to help you quickly make the adjustment for all existing accounts. Note: this has been tested under the US version and cannot guarantee will work on non-english servers. If you find it does or doesn't work but can provide a fix please let me know and I will update.
