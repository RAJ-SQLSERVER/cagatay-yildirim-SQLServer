/*
    
Generic paged data like MySQL LIMIT

This works, however code is creating a live temp_1 table in the database instead of using a #temp_1 temporary table because is just would not work.

The next idea I had was to use a unique table name per connection for temp_1, but I would really rather use temporary tables.

I am hoping some SQL guru's can suggest some improvements to this script.
