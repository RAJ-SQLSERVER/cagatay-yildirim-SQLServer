/*
OSQL Process Watcher

These 2 files plus sleep.exe (Resource kit) gives an administrator a good view of important blocking statistics in almost a real time fashion. You can use this with profiler to obtain some unique information very fast on a lead blocker if your gathering the right counters in profiler and dumping them in a table and querying it correctly. Put all 3 files in the same directory. You will want to adjust the properties of the cmd window screen buffer size regarding height and width so you can scroll around.
