/*
List Queries That Could Benefit From an Index

Description

Sample stored procedure that creates an XML query plan indicating whether or not a query would benefit from an index. Because indexes are alternatives to table scans, the purpose of a proposed index is to avoid big I/Os. The stored procedure, which requires Microsoft SQL Server 2005, indicates that an index could be useful for the query in question only.
