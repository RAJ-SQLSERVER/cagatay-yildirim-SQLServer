Verify Last successful CHECKDB on all databases

After reading an interesting blog post from Paul Randal about how to verify the last good CHECKDB that occurred for a database, I decided that I would create a report to add to my daily monitoring regimen.

This script is the basis for my report. It utilizes a feature in SQL Server 2005 which records the most recent successful CHECKDB in the boot page of the database.

I enumerate through each database using a cursor and return a simple result set to tell me the most recent occurrence of a successful CHECKDB, how many days it has been, and how many hours it has been. I then have this as the source of an Excel database query for each of the instances I support. It is a quick and dirty way to monitor the integrity of your databases.
