/*
List Locks and Reads

Description

Sample stored procedure that lists locks and reads. Range locks (serializable) disallows inserting in the range, while key locks (repeatable read) allow inserts (also known as phantoms). This stored procedure, contributed by Microsoft's Tom Davidson, requires SQL Server 2005.
